# About me

I currently work as a HPC consultant at the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be)
in the [CalcUA supercomputer service](https://hpc.uantwerpen.be) which is also part of the
[Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum (Flemish Supercomputer Centre)](https://vscentrum.be).
Since January 2021, half of my time is spent working on a project led by CSC Finland, in the user support team for [LUMI](https://lumi-supercomputer.eu), one of the EuroHPC pre-exascale systems. 
Within the LUMI User Support Team (LUST) I work on software installation and management of the scientific software stack, and training and user documentation. I am the lead developer of the module system for the 
software stack and the EasyBuild setup on LUMI.
For the other half of my time I work for the CalcUA facility of the Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum. My tasks there include working on the technical requirements for procurements, user support, software installation and optimisation and development of user documentation and training.

Links to some of my work are found at the top of the page:

-   [Supercomputers for Starters](SupercomputersForStarters) (work-in-progress): 
    Course notes for a course that I teach as part of the introductory courses for new users of the
    University of Antwerpen HPC users, and which may evolve into a course also used for a larger audience.
-   [EasyBuild for LUMI training](easybuild-tutorial) links to EasyBuild training materials which include 
    a training for advanced EasyBuild users on LUMI that I developed based on the [other EasyBuild
    training materials](https://easybuild.io/tutorial).
-   [Win for HPC](windows-client-HPC) (work-in-progress) are pages from something that is more of a hobby project, exploring how
     Windows can be used to access HPC systems and even to develop software that will be used on HPC systems.
     These pages are in their very early stages.
-   [Connecting from macOS to Linux](macos-to-linux) (work in progress) are a set of notes about accessing Linux
    machines and in particular supercomputers from macOS. It is more of a personal knowledge base made available
    to others than a document that tries to be complete and is the result of what I use myself at work and tickets
    I processed at the [Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum](https://vscentrum.be) and
    [LUMI](https://lumi-supercomputer.eu) User Support Team.
-   [LUMI Tips&Tricks](https://klust.github.io/LUMI-tips-and-tricks/) is a page where I bundle 
    some stuff that I have discovered on LUMI and that is hard to find 
    in the HPE Cray or LUMI documentation or hard to give a good place in the latter
    (and to maintain, some of it may be outdated). Sometimes this knowledge comes from
    reverse-enbgineering scripts and module files of the PE.
