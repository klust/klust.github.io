# About me

I currently work as a HPC consultant at the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be)
in the [CalcUA supercomputer service](https://hpc.uantwerpen.be) which is also part of the
[Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum (Flemish Supercomputer Centre)](https://vscentrum.be).
Since January 2021, half of my time is spent working on a project led by CSC Finland, in the user support team for [LUMI](https://lumi-supercomputer.eu), one of the EuroHPC pre-exascale systems. 
Within the LUMI User Support Team (LUST) I work on software installation and management of the scientific software stack, and training and user documentation. I am the lead developer of the module system for the 
software stack and the EasyBuild setup on LUMI.
For the other half of my time I work for the CalcUA facility of the Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum. My tasks there include working on the technical requirements for procurements, user support, software installation and optimisation and development of user documentation and training.

Links to some of my work are found at the top of the page:

-   [EasyBuild for LUMI training](easybuild-tutorial) links to EasyBuild training materials which include 
    a training for advanced EasyBuild users on LUMI that I developed based on the [other EasyBuild
    training materials](https://easybuild.io/tutorial).
-   [The missing Cray PE manual](craype-missing-manual) are pages containing various bits and pieces of information
    about the HPE Cray Programming Environment that I discovered using it or on various sites or sometimes by 
    reverse-engineering scripts and module files of the PE.
-   [Win for HPC](windows-client-HPC) are pages from something that is more of a hobby project, exploring how
     Windows can be used to access HPC systems and even to develop software that will be used on HPC systems.
     These pages are in their very early stages.
