## Other interests and additional information

-   Currently single
-   Sports: Mostly hiking and some cycling.
-   I like listening to music, I also work as a volunteer in the logistics team of a 
    local symphonic orchestra (Frascati Symphonic).
-   I am a volunteer for UniQue, the regional LGBTQ+-organization for Vlaams-Brabant.
-   I like travelling. During my holidays, I usually do rather sporty trips and every 
    now and then a short city trip. Two memorable trips were a study trip to Taiwan 
    and South Korea with the students of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science 
    of the University of Groningen and a trip to Ecuador in 2003 with two climbs of 
    (non-technical) 5000m-summits.
