-   [Using Windows as a client and development platform for HPC](https://klust.github.io/windows-client-HPC)
-   [Connecting from macOS to Linux](https://klust.github.io/macos-to-linux)
-   [LUMI Tips&Tricks](https://klust.github.io/LUMI-tips-and-tricks/) is a page where I bundle 
    some stuff that I have discovered on LUMI and that is hard to find 
    in the HPE Cray or LUMI documentation or hard to give a good place in the latter
    (and to maintain, some of it may be outdated).
